# Personal Configuration

My Operating System is arch linux and you can install the following software based on your operating system.


## zsh
zsh is a wonderful shell with beautiful themes and useful plugins. It is much better than bash.
And my plugin manmager is zinit whose turbo model is fast and powerful(I love it :smile:).

### theme
After installing ,what you want to do first is to choose a theme
I recommend you to use [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) which is a very beautiful theme and has many features.

In my powerlevel10k configuration file, I change the background color and the color of the prompt to make it more beautiful.
